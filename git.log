commit 271c38cefb0bb395df2c958019ec51c3311a9df9
Author: limpygnome <limpygnome@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 27 02:34:19 2014 +0000

    Major security flaws allowed in sandbox to support Scanner; this is required since Scanner is often used for amateur programming. Since the JVM is executed under a restricted user and many other actions are restricted, this should be fairly safe. The ability to use reflection on any field may be an issue, however it will not be able to disable the security-manager.

    Major improvements to the way CodeJava handles fragments of code; updated PluginObjectInputStream to use more efficient method of loading classes.

    Created new sandbox plugin for safely executing code, which uses the SecurityManager to prohibit potentially dangerous features of the JVM. This would serve as an additional layer of security, on top of e.g. running the JVM as a different user.

    Fixed critical plugin loading bug by copying jars, and their depend files, to a separate directory. This allows the URLLoader to keep the (Java) archive, of the plugin, open during runtime to load dependencies. Plugins can also be dependent upon other plugins, which saves having to copy the jars of other plugins.

Date:   Fri Dec 20 23:24:31 2013 +0000

    Fixed major bug with cookies in PALS_Servlet (also added the ability to set status codes and redirect). Further progress with DefaultAuth. Modified layout. Few changes and general bugfixes. Added security classes. Added Captcha plugin. However a major bug has been discovered with plugin loading, where the classloader has to be kept open to load dependencies/libraries; this also creates a file-lock, thus an IDE cannot recompile and reload a jar.

    Added UUID identification of nodes, logging is now in the shared storage, logging now places logs in separate folders based on node UUID, updated RuntimePLuginReloader (plugin) to use shared path for templates, NodeCore checks temp/templates/logs dirs exist in shared storage on start-up.

Date:   Wed Dec 18 05:56:01 2013 +0000

    Added caching of bytes and hyphens to UUID (base) due to predicted excessive usage over the duration of a runtime; the memory is very little compared to the repetitive processing.

    Implemented templating (using FreeMarker and my own technique for functions) (tested), created initial layout for website, improved and extended NodeCore code, plugin (base) cleaned-up, plugin events deleted (no longer needed, apart of design phase), UUID null checking added (to avoid a bug), UrlTree documentation added, initial WebManager complete (working as intended)(needs authentication handling yet though), file-stream bug fixed in Files (utils - stream not closed), futher extensions upon Remote Request+Response, further extensions of Example plugin to demonstrate hooking and templating,  extended Runtime Plugin Reloader to reload templates.

    Added runtime plugin reloader (allows jars/plugins to be reloaded during the runtime without restarting PALS node - tested and works), modified settings to allow strings (as opposed to just ints) for data-types. General bug-fixes. Extended UUID class to override equals and hash-code (for native support of collections).

Date:   Mon Dec 16 01:53:42 2013 +0000

    Bug-fixes to NodeCore.java and Files.java (minor). General relationship between NodeCore (base) and Node (PALS Node) cleaned-up, using notify/wait - original forever-loop was for initial design+testing purposes. Plugins can now be reloaded during runtime from the same path (tested on Windows 8). Cleaned-up Example plugin to reflect changes.

Date:   Sun Dec 15 02:48:04 2013 +0000

    Cleaned up configuration files, major revamp of web-end (and initial creation finished - fields/files uploading, request/response handling). bug-fix and info improvements in plugin-manager, NodeCore (base) improvements, introduction of storage class, files can be uploaded and stored in a temp directory between the web and RMI ends, logging stdout/stderr improved (redacted EOE tag).

Date:   Wed Nov 20 03:44:46 2013 +0000

    Example plugin now outputs to the website, using UrlTree with fixed path. This proves the architecture, using RMI, will most likely work quite well. Testing of posted files needs to be done though, but this should be as simple as sending byte-arrays in the response wrapper.

commit fe2ac18f20937d8ba7938d3d633891a2c0597e62
Author: limpygnome <limpygnome@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 20 03:34:46 2013 +0000

    Minor changes in RMI architecture (passing of response object) due to new understanding of how it works with return values. 'hello world...' now prints to the website! Just to wrap the rest of the request data, parse the path data, load templates properly (as well as implement rendering) and an actual basic web-page can be displayed.

Author: limpygnome <limpygnome@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 20 01:11:13 2013 +0000

    Progress save. UUID RNG improved/fixed, added UrlTree data-structure, idea of web-manager implemented. This is very close to (hopefully) processing a web-page over RMI.

commit 3fbda085a1b2121cfed1919aee9caaa0c46693c0
Author: limpygnome <limpygnome@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 19 00:41:36 2013 +0000

    Progress save; initial architecture near completion for test. RMI idea has majorly altered the original concept/idea of the system, making it easier and more secure for plugins.

commit 50840b59687c020914a495cf4cf618b0519949c7
Author: limpygnome <limpygnome@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Nov 16 21:49:52 2013 +0000

    Progress save; a few ideas on template loading have been changed, PASLP will not be made and will use RMI instead. Web-pages will also be built on nodes using RMI, increasing security. This will make certain NodeCore functions easier, since it won't need to be loaded inside a web-pool.

commit 34d6e22966ab81673523bf129cff4b4a4e525476
Author: limpygnome <limpygnome@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 13 00:29:39 2013 +0000

    Base of website implemented for handling requests, although this will most likely be extended in the future (not a high priority ~ e.g. adding directories other than content to not be handled by PALS). RMI also tested. RMI will be used for building pages on a node, saves having to load plugins in the web-app pool (which gets disposed frequently).
