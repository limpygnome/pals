The following packages are required:
- fontconfig
- xorg-server
- ttf-dejavu
- sshpass

You will also need both the JRE and JDK installed:
- jre-openjdk
- jdk-openjdk

Refer to your package manager for name specifics.

This has been tested on 32-bit and 64-bit distributions of Arch; if the system is not running within a GUI environment,
the node base will need to be launched with headless mode for graphics rendering (as used by the captcha plugin):

Simply append '-Djava.awt.headless=true' as a parameter when launching the JVM.

Also make sure the separate, low-privileged, user account has a home directory; this is not used by the sandbox, but
SSH will generate an error which will appear in any sandbox output.

To create a low-privileged user:
useradd <username>
passwd <username>
- enter password
