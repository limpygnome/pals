Requirements - Windows
======================
This has been tested on Windows 7 and 8 completely.

Environment
-----------
You will need both the JDK 7 and JRE 7 installed; you will also need an additional user for executing the sandbox.

To create an account:

**net user <username> <password> /add**

By default, the username and password *test* are used. This can be altered by changing the node configuration
file. To create the default account, type:

**net user test test /add**
